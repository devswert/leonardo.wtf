    <p class="mb-4">
      I started acquiring technical knowledge when I was 18. I studied in a
      technical school where I got a technical title in telecommunications.
      After that, from 2013 until 2017, I worked during the day and learned
      Computer Engineering at Duoc UC at night. Honestly, I don’t feel that I
      learned a lot there. I acquired more knowledge and valuable tools working
      in different kinds of companies.

      I completed some courses in Udemy about Flutter, GraphQL, and AWS
      CloudFormation.
