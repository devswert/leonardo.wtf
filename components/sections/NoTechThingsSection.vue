        I live with my partner, my little princess (my daughter), 2 bunnies, and
        2 cockatiels. It's a beautiful family, even if it sometimes looks like a
        zoo. For some years, I volunteered in a pet rescue ONG; spending time
        helping animals was something meaningful, and I hope to help again in
        another organization. I love a good cup of coffee with a V60 Dripper and
        tasty beans. Sometimes, I play cards with friends, like Magic or Mitos y
        Leyendas, a Chilean card game. With my partner, we play Overcooked 2
        <b>a lot</b>. We love that game.
