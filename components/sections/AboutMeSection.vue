      About Me
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I'm a software engineer with ~10 years of experience. I started working
      when I was 18, and during this time, I've learned and grown in different
      ways, understanding what software engineering is and how I want to
      generate an impact in a company where I believe in its mission and vision.
      Something I love about my job, or my role as a software engineer, is
      solving problems and finding the best option to help people do their jobs.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I've worked with hybrid mobile apps, frontend, backend, and some
      architecture things (I love learning new stuff). I am a person who loves
      code, and every day, I try to be a better software engineer, improving my
      quality as a professional, taking care of details in things I'm building,
      creating good documentation, and working as a team.
